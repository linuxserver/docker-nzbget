  Webui can be found at `<your-ip>:6789` and the default login details (change ASAP) are

  `login:nzbget, password:tegbzn6789`

  To allow scheduling, from the webui set the time correction value in settings/logging.

  You can add an additional mount point for intermediate unpacking folder with:-

  `-v /path/to/nzbget/intermediate:/intermediate`

  for example, and changing the setting for InterDir in the PATHS tab of settings to `/intermediate`

  ### Media folders

  We have set `/downloads` as a ***optional path***, this is because it is the easiest way to get started. While easy to use, it has some drawbacks. Mainly losing the ability to atomic move (TL;DR instant file moves, rather than copy+delete) files while processing content.

  Use the optional paths if you don't understand, or don't want hardlinks/atomic moves.

  The folks over at servarr.com wrote a good [write-up](https://wiki.servarr.com/docker-guide#consistent-and-well-planned-paths) on how to get started with this.
